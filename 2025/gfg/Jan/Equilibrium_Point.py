"""
Given an array of integers arr[], the task is to find the first 
equilibrium point in the array.

The equilibrium point in an array is an index 
(0-based indexing) such that the sum of all elements 
before that index is the same as the sum of elements after it. 
Return -1 if no such point exists. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 3]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The sum of left of index 2 is 1 + 2 = 3 and sum on 
right of index 2 is 0 + 3 = 3.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no equilibrium index in the array.

Input: arr[] = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sum of left of index 3 is -7 + 1 + 5 = -1 and 
sum on right of index 3 is -4 + 3 + 0 = -1.
